## About Pierre Guilbault
Born in Atlanta, GA but raised in Vancouver B.C. I have had the fortunate experiences of living in culturally ecclectic cities in North America and Europe. From Vacouver, to New York, and reccently Paris, not only have I lived in large bustling cities, but because of the type of work I have been doing up until now I have been able to travel a lot as well. Before Covid, and still to this day, I was/am a dance artist. I have performed all over Europe and the United States, I have also traveled with work and for pleasure to Asian, Arab, and European countries.

A year ago, when the pandemic first hit, I was staying with friends in Brittany in the north of France. After a few weeks time started to be plentiful and empty, so I began some self-taught coding research. I started with python, and then quickly added HTML, CSS, COBOL, and eventually Ruby. I thouroughly enjoyed the endless possibilities and the creativity I was able to couple with my analytical and logical interests from school when I was a chemistry and math major.

It began with an interest to be able to create a webpage for my dance and arts career. It quickly blossomed to a window into the world of opportunity. I realized that I would be able to open up so many doors with programming languages, and that perhaps I could add to my life as a dancer and find some stability in this ever changing and unkown future we barrel towards every day. So why not add new tools to my belt to help build the life I wanted.

Travel has always been a huge passion and excitement in my life. With dancd I was able to do a lot of it, but with things coming to a standstill this last year I realized I needed something new that could guarantee my ability to keep moving around the globe while staying connected and working. Enter the world of programming, something, that in my eyes, would allow me to stay remote and hard at work while exploring the endless wonder of the world. Hello world wont just be my first line of code written, it will be my slogan going forward in life. "Hello, world!"
